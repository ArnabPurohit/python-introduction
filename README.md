# Intorduction to Python

This is a short 90 minute lecture that introduces python. There are
no assumptions made at all about knowledge of python.

The lecture is written as a juypiter notebook, using the popular
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) extension to present
the material as a slideshow.
